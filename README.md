This project was carried out by a group of five people as part of an educational program.
The program is a console application that allows you to sort, search and write objects to a file.
My part of the work was writing the TrialList and TrialBinarySearch classes. TrialList implements the basic functionality of the ArrayList class. TrialBinarySearch performs binary search on sorted collections.
